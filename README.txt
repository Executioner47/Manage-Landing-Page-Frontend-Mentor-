BELOW I DESCRIBED WHAT THE FUTURE WEBSITE IS LIKE, BUT I EMPHASIZE, I ONLY NEED THE CSS3/HTML5 PART.

The project consists of creating a website/platform where you can
find bands from the brotherhood area of different musical styles.
User registration will be free and will be necessary for users to be able to use all the functionalities.
Users will be able to consult the bands that are available for a certain date
(hotel type) but they will not be able to reserve them because we are talking about contracts
complexes, although they will be able to know if it is available to start negotiating
with this.
It will include the basic functionalities of a CRUD:
Create: This operation will allow bands to register on the platform and create their profile,
providing information such as the name of the band, the number of members, the
location and musical style. This information would be stored in the database of the
platform.
Read: This operation could be used to allow users to search and view profiles
of the bands on the platform, accessing all the information stored in the database
data.
Update: This operation could be used to allow bands to update their profile
on the platform, modifying the information stored in the database.
Remove: This operation could be used to allow gangs to remove your profile from the
platform, eliminating the information stored in the database.
In addition, the platform administrators could manage the profiles of the bands,
Being able to eliminate those that do not comply with the standards or are not updated.
General characteristics of the site:
It will have a desktop version and one adapted to mobile phones and tablets with a more
simple and intuitive.
In the desktop version, in its header you will have the following tabs:
-Home: Directs to the home page, in the body of the page will appear a carousel of
images and as we go down, other advertising and information of interest will appear.
-Bands: Directs to the search engine, in which a list of all available bands will appear
without filtering, there you will be able to consult the bands that are available for a certain
date and the rest of its characteristics.
-Blog: In which there will be relevant hiring posts, advice articles
how to find your ideal band and other information of interest.
-Contact: It will contain an email form in case you have any questions or if you
they do not find the desired band.
In addition, in the upper corner there will be the registration and logging option in which it would put
do you manage a band? Register or Login or similar Register now or Login
In the registration form they must provide all the relevant information that will be
included in the database (Name, profile photo, information, etc..). that besides
will be able to edit later in their profile tab, they will also have a
calendar in which they can put if that day is available or busy.
Once the desired band has been selected, the following will appear on the band tab
information:
-Description of the band.
-Repertoire
-Multimedia elements: Youtube videos and photographs in which they appear.
- Your contact (e-mail and telephone).
-Link to your RRSS
Information already collected in the contact form and your profile
In the footer of the page put the following:
-Privacy Policy: In which it redirects to a page that reads the rights of the
user in terms of data protection.
-Legal notice: In which the user is given information about the legality of the website and
who manages it
-Replaces a redirection to the band registry
-Links to social networks
-Contact
-And redirects to specific filters, for example
musical groups
Bands
Bugle and drum bands
chapel music
Clicking on any of these redirects us to the bands tab with the search filter for
each of these applied, this will be good for the SEO of the page and the search engines
can better segment different search results
